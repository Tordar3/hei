            I feel like shit. I think she thinks I'm a loner, and as a consequense, thinks less of me. I do fit the requirements of being a loner, even though I have friends and a loving family.
The main feeling of the day is definitely afraidness. Afraid of the future. Not that I've had a realiziation that I won't become anything and that my life is worthless. It's more about my development as a person.
This is the first point in my life where I feel genuinely alone. Even from my parents and family. The summer will be hell for me, and I already know it. My father told me he hasn't involved me in his plans for his trip
with his side of the family, and my mother has already gone to the other side of the country. All I've got for this summer is constant pressure that I need to work, whereas my actual wish is just to travel with money
I don't have. I come from a upper middle class family with two cars in the driveway and a lovely view and a trampoline. I have enough food in my fridge to make by and financial backing from my family, but I feel poor. 
Maybe due to the girl I've just taken interest in. Allow me to correct; the girl I'm obsessed with. I don't even know if she is the one, but my entire day-to-day mood depends on how she feels about me. Mostly it has
been fine, because she is actually pretty nice. But she is also spontaneous, and wants to travel, just as me. But the difference is that I say that I wanna go back to Japan, but I can't. She also wants to go to Japan,
and she can, anytime. Her family is rich and she doesn't have to stay at home for the whole summer just to work (me). Shes also going to business school in the States for the summer, and I can't help but think that
she'll meet someone. Because she is truly amazing, and she deserves the world. I feel handicapped. I wanna see the world, but my reality is just sitting in my room the whole day and having the same 1 hour to 90 minute
walk every single mother fucking day. I feel trapped. And noone will jailbreak me, because noone actually cares enough. Is that my fault? For being a grade A avoider? All my life I've been avoiding social settings, girls
confrontation and challenges. Take this summer for example. Two of my good friends will leave for China without me, and its noones fault but my own. I want to cry just thinking about it. 
I'm afraid because everyone will leave me this summer, and I will just be sitting here. Lonely. And no one will notice or care, because why would they? All my life I've been keeping everyone at arms length. My best
friend doesnt know that I'm obsessed with a girl that makes me want to kill myself one day, and makes me wanna fly to China the next day. My parents doesn't even know me. The girl I'm talking to is just one of the 
few people that listen to me, or at least she pretends. But I know deep down that one day she will leave me for a perfect Chinese man, or a handsome american dick. And she will never look back. 
I'll have to save some for tomorrow, I'm going on a run now, got school tomorrow. Goodnight, get ur beauty sleep.

        Today is better. I don't want to kill myself. The best thing is that I don't feel better purely because of her, but also because I met a friend from class. I also made plans to go play badminton
tomorrow with some other friends, theyre nice. I went to the library today. It's nice not going straight home after school, makes me feel like I do something. 
A weird thing happened today, a girl kept looking at me. It was in my class, and she wasn't flirting (at least I don't think so), but she kept looking at me. The optimal version of me would confront this with
a nice or funny way to acquire her social media, or at least talk to her outside of class. She is attractive, but also pretty quiet. I don't know myself. I have people telling me in one class that they never
heard me talk properly in over a year, while in another class I feel like I have intellectual authority. Not because I'm way smarter than everyone, but because I can easily give myself the role of sparking
engagement or taking initiative to start the activity etc. 
I think the girl from class is cute, and maybe she thinks I'm cute too, but thats not the most important thing now. The important thing is how I should act with the Chinese girl.

        It's been a nice day. Played some badminton, got a job interview and my friend also passed his driving test. So I feel good, still I have this nag about the chinese girl. Maybe I should focus more about the
positives. Gratefullness has always been very important for me, it's one of the most highly set values of mine. But at the same time, I don't want to neglect the fading spark between me and the chinese girl,
因为我喜欢她。为什么，因为她很漂亮，也很聪明。她有意思。But she drives me crazy. A positive is that she hasn't shown too much interest today, but I still feel pretty good. Maybe thats because of the other positive 
factors from today? If so, what do I do when she doesn't take interest and I don't have a good day for myself? Will I be in total ruins? Maybe I'll have to work on that, yeah, definitely. My late night runs have 
been helping me tho. And I know it's not new for physical activity to help mental health, but isn't that purely because I'm disctracted? Is avoiding to think about it the best way to handle it? But that doesn't
even make sense, because I think about her all the time. But maybe distractions is everything? Do you stop thinking of someone because you don't like them, or because something more fun is stealing the brain space?
If so, is that bad? Is it bad that 20 seconds of a loss of focus can spin me off track and ruin my mood by making me think about her? Is it bad if you get sad if you just let yourself out of the tunnel vision for 
just 20 seconds? Maybe that's life, trying to manipulate your own brain to ignore the negatives and focus on the positives. I don't know. If only there was proffesional people I could talk to that had a long
education of trying to figure out what's going on inside my head, oh well.
